    <section aria-labelledby="initial-vision">
      <h2 id="initial-vision">Initial Vision</h2>
      <p>I remember your first brief clearly: transform the Swiss design site into a Flat Design gallery with a strict palette, Roboto typography, two-dimensional icons, 4px card radii, and a 12-column grid. My interpretation prioritized tokenized CSS variables, a responsive 12-col layout, and an icon system that used stroke=currentColor so icons could inherit color from context. Early ambiguity centered on exact icon stroke weight and whether some decorative elements (like the hero illustration) were acceptable; I erred on the side of adding subtle visuals and you steered me back to restraint.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="research-phase">
      <h2 id="research-phase">Research Phase</h2>
      <p>We explored references together—Swiss typographic rules, iOS7 screenshots for the flat aesthetic, and classic flat-design token libraries. The most useful references were your provided style guides and the repo’s templates. From those sources we distilled key characteristics: strict color blocks, neutral backgrounds, no shadows, bold geometric icons, and an orderly spacing scale (8, 16, 24, 32, 48).</p>

      <h2 id="build-process">Build Process</h2>
      <p><strong>Sprint 1 — Foundation.</strong> I scaffolded a <code>public/</code> demo, created <code>css/flat.css</code> with tokens, and wired Roboto. What worked: a clear variable-driven approach so styles could be changed centrally. What didn’t: I initially left some anchors and decorative SVGs that created unexpected spacing; we fixed these in later iterations.</p>

      <p><strong>Sprint 2 — Components.</strong> We iterated on cards, buttons, and the icon sprite. You asked for Roboto and uppercase headings; I updated the stylesheet and templates. The icon sprite was expanded and inlined for cross-origin safety. Iterations included stroke-weight tweaks (from 3px to ~2.5px) and replacing anchors with semantic <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements.</p>

      <p><strong>Sprint 3 — Polish.</strong> Final refinements included spacing samples in the style guide, a grid demo, ARIA labels, and responsive tweaks for mobile/tablet. I removed a decorative hero that caused a gap and adjusted nav behavior for small screens.</p>

      <h2 id="challenges">Challenges &amp; Solutions</h2>
      <p>Ambiguity sometimes slowed us—briefs like “make it look more professional” are subjective. When I over-designed (extra SVGs, too-large illustration), you called it out and we simplified. I also introduced a small accessibility issue by using <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for button-like actions; we corrected that to semantic <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and added ARIA labels. The collaboration worked because you gave decisive, iterative feedback (e.g., “make the font Roboto”, “do all” for icon expansion) and I responded with concrete edits.</p>
    </section>

    <section aria-labelledby="evolution">
      <h2 id="evolution">Evolution</h2>
      <p>The gallery evolved from a Swiss-inspired grid into a cohesive flat system. Key decisions that improved authenticity: using tokens for palette and spacing, inlining the SVG sprite for reliability, and standardizing icon stroke behavior with <code>stroke=currentColor</code>. We learned that Flat Design’s discipline is about subtraction—removing unnecessary depth and keeping systems consistent.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="reflection">
      <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
      <p>This partnership worked because we paired strengths: you brought taste and decisions; I handled repetitive edits and technical wiring. Human-AI collaboration is strongest when humans set direction and the AI iterates quickly with concrete artifacts. For students: define tokens early, prefer semantic markup, and keep icons stroke-based for flexibility. Be brave about simplification—less is often better in flat systems.</p>
