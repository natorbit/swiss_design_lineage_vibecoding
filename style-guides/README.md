## 💡 Tips for Independent Research

**Don't Rely on Pinterest:**
Find authoritative sources (museums, books, original designers' work).

**Study the Masters:**
Every style has pioneers. Find their work and study it deeply.

**Document Everything:**
Save sources, take notes, extract design tokens (colors, fonts, spacing).

**Use Existing Guides as Templates:**
Follow the structure of completed guides for consistency.

**Ask AI for Help:**
> "I'm researching [Style]. Help me find authoritative sources, key practitioners, and canonical examples. Where should I look?"

**Focus on Principles, Not Just Aesthetics:**
Understand WHY the style looks the way it does, not just WHAT it looks like.
