2. **Focus on design translation** (not building from scratch)
3. **AI handles repetitive tasks** (color changes, component restyling)
4. **Clear scope** (adapt, not create)
5. **Realistic timeline** (compressed but doable)

### What Makes This Educational

1. **Research required** (can't fake understanding style)
2. **Design decisions documented** (must explain choices)
3. **AI collaboration practiced** (prompt engineering matters)
4. **Quality standards enforced** (accessibility non-negotiable)
5. **Professional output** (portfolio-worthy work)

### What Makes This Scalable

1. **15 style options** (distribute across class)
2. **Your site as baseline** (everyone starts equally)
3. **Clear rubric** (consistent grading)
4. **Automated testing** (Lighthouse, validators)
5. **Digital submission** (GitHub + live URLs)
