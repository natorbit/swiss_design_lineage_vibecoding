## 🎯 Project Overview

## Project Overview

You will transform Keith's Swiss-style portfolio site into a **completely different design style** using AI collaboration. This isn't about writing code—it's about developing taste, making design decisions, and strategically directing an AI agent to execute your vision.

You will **select one design style** from the Swiss Design lineage and **adapt** Keith Williams' Swiss-style portfolio site to match your chosen style's visual language and principles.

### What Makes This Different

**The Goal:** Translate the existing technical structure into a new design language while maintaining professional standards.

**You write ZERO code manually.** This is pure vibe coding:

- You talk to AI, describe what you want---

- AI generates code in VS Code with Copilot

- You review visually (screenshots)## What You're Given

- You critique like an art director

- You iterate until excellent### Reference Implementation

- **Keith's Swiss Style Site**: `references/swiss_site`

**The AI is blind.** You are its eyes:  - Complete working Eleventy site

- AI cannot see what the site looks like  - Swiss Design implementation

- You must provide screenshots constantly  - Professional-quality code

- Your job is design judgment and quality control  - Perfect Lighthouse scores

- AI's job is technical execution  - Full accessibility compliance



**You develop taste and standards:**### Documentation

- Not "does it work?" but "is it excellent?"- **Swiss Style History**: Understanding the origin point

- Review each section 2-3 times minimum- **Swiss Technical Spec**: How the reference site works

- Use AI as different experts (UX designer, literary critic, accessibility specialist)- **Base Requirements**: Non-negotiable standards (accessibility, performance)

- Iterate until professional quality

---

### What You'll Create

## Your Task

1. **A fully transformed website** in your chosen design style

2. **3+ blog posts** documenting your journey### Transform, Don't Rebuild

3. **A collaboration story page** where the AI reflects on your partnership (breaking the 4th wall)

4. **Professional quality** (Lighthouse 90+, accessible, responsive)You are **adapting** the existing site, not building from scratch:

5. **Complete documentation** of the vibe coding process

1. **Keep the technical foundation** (Eleventy, Tailwind, structure)

### What You're Learning2. **Change the design system** (colors, typography, spacing, components)

3. **Maintain quality standards** (accessibility, performance, responsive)

- How to strategically collaborate with AI4. **Document your decisions** (why you made each change)

- How to develop design judgment and taste

- How to review and critique visual workThink of it like **reskinning** a well-built framework with authentic design language.

- How to use AI as specialized experts

- How to produce professional work rapidly---

- How to know when to stop AI from going off track

## Phase 4: Build & Iterate (6 hours)### Design Authenticity (Must Demonstrate)



### GoalYour site should **clearly represent** your chosen style:

Transform the site through strategic AI collaboration, iterative design reviews, and continuous refinement.- ✅ Color palette matches style characteristics

- ✅ Typography reflects style principles

### The Vibe Coding Process- ✅ Layout patterns authentic to style

- ✅ Components styled appropriately

**You are the art director. AI is the designer/developer.**- ✅ Overall aesthetic recognizable



**Your job:****Ask yourself:** Would someone familiar with [your style] recognize it in your site?

- Describe what you want in natural language

- Provide screenshots constantly (AI is blind)---

- Review each section 2-3 times minimum

- Critique with specific feedback## AI Collaboration Guidelines

- Use AI as different experts (UX designer, accessibility specialist, literary critic)

- Stop AI when suggestions become extreme or out of scope### Effective AI Prompts



**AI's job:****Good Prompt Example:**

- Generate code based on your descriptions```

- Implement design changesI need to adapt this Swiss design button to Material Design.

- Run audits and find problems

- Iterate based on your feedbackCurrent Swiss button:

- Execute technical tasks- Black border, 2px

- White background

### Sprint 1: Foundation (2 hours)

- Sharp corners (border-radius: 0)

**Goals:** Transform basic design elements (colors, typography, layout structure)- 56px min-height



**1. Kick Off Sprint (30 min)**Material Design requirements:

- Elevation (shadow, not border)

**Prompt:**- Primary color background

> "Let's start Sprint 1 from our plan. Begin by transforming the foundational design elements: color palette, typography scale, and basic layout structure. Refer to `docs/design-system.md` for specifications. Work on the homepage first."- White text

- 4px border-radius

**Watch AI work in VS Code.** Copilot will suggest code. Hit **ESC** if suggestions look wrong.- Ripple effect on click

- 48dp height

**2. First Look Review (30 min)**

Generate the updated CSS maintaining accessibility.

After AI makes changes:```

- Save and preview the site locally

- Take screenshots of the homepage**Bad Prompt Example:**

- Compare to your reference images```

Make this button Material Design.

**Prompt AI as UX Designer:**```

> "Acting as a UX designer, review this homepage screenshot compared to these [style] reference images. What's working? What's not matching the style? Be specific about typography, spacing, colors, and layout."

### Iteration Strategy

AI provides critique. You decide what to fix.

1. **Be specific** - Include exact requirements

**3. Iterate Based on Feedback (2 hours)**2. **Provide context** - Explain what you're changing from/to

3. **Request explanation** - Ask AI to explain its reasoning

Give AI specific directions:4. **Validate output** - Check against your design system

- "The typography feels too tight. Increase line height."5. **Refine iteratively** - Make small changes, test, repeat

- "Color contrast isn't strong enough. Check accessibility."

- "The grid doesn't match [style] patterns. Make it more [asymmetric/structured/loose]."### When AI Gets It Wrong

- "This doesn't look right on mobile. Fix the responsive behavior."

AI will make mistakes. Your job is to:

**Take new screenshots after each change.** Compare to references.- ✅ Catch errors (especially accessibility issues)

- ✅ Verify against your style research

**Repeat 2-3 times** until the foundation feels right.- ✅ Test in browser (don't trust output blindly)

- ✅ Ask follow-up questions when confused

**4. Tech Debt Audit 1 (1 hour)**- ✅ Document what worked and what didn't



**Prompt:**---

> "Conduct a technical debt audit. Find: code duplication, accessibility issues (color contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML), performance problems (unoptimized images, render-blocking resources), unused CSS/JS, mobile responsiveness issues. List specific files and line numbers."

## Submission Requirements

**AI generates the draft.**

**2. Review and Refine Collaboration Story (2 hours)**

Read the AI's draft critically:

**Check for:**
- [ ] Does it sound authentic to our actual process?
- [ ] Are specific details included (not generic)?
- [ ] Does it break the fourth wall effectively?
- [ ] Are the numbers accurate (time, iterations)?
- [ ] Is it honest about mistakes and struggles?
- [ ] Does it explain design decisions clearly?
- [ ] Will readers learn something valuable?

**Refine with AI:**
> "This section feels too generic. Add specific details about when I told you to stop because [specific example]."
>
> "Expand the 'What We Learned' section with concrete insights."
>
> "Add a section about [specific challenge we faced]."

**Add your own voice:**
- Include personal reflections AI can't know
- Add specific moments that stood out to you
- Clarify any technical details
- Ensure honesty about the process

**3. Final Quality Audit (30 min)**

**Prompt:**
> "Review the entire site one final time and give it scores out of 100 for:
> 1. Design Authenticity (how well it matches [style])
> 2. Technical Quality (code, performance, accessibility)
> 3. Visual Consistency (systematic design across all pages)
> 4. Content Quality (blog posts, collaboration story)
> 5. Overall Professional Polish
>
> For each category, explain the score and suggest any final improvements."

Review AI's assessment. Decide if final improvements are worth the time.

**4. Create README Documentation (30 min)**

**Prompt:**
> "Create a comprehensive README.md for this project that includes:
> - Project title and description
> - Design style chosen and why
> - Key features and characteristics
> - Technologies used (Eleventy, Tailwind, etc.)
> - How to run locally (install, build, serve)
> - Lighthouse scores achieved
> - Credits (me as designer/director, you as AI implementation partner, Keith Williams' Swiss site as foundation)
> - Link to live site
> - Link to collaboration story page"

Review and refine.

## 🎯 Vibe Coding Best Practices

### Working with AI in VS Code + Copilot

**Watch AI work:**
- Copilot suggests code as you (or AI chat) types
- Suggestions appear in gray text
- Press **Tab** to accept, **ESC** to reject

**When to stop AI:**
- Suggestions duplicate existing code
- Breaking accessibility (removing alt text, semantic HTML)
- Overcomplicating simple solutions
- Ignoring mobile considerations
- Resetting styles you already set
- Creating inconsistent patterns

**How to stop:**
- Press **ESC** to reject suggestion
- **CMD+Z** (Mac) or **CTRL+Z** (Windows) to undo
- Tell AI: "Stop. That's going in the wrong direction."

### Using AI as Different Experts

Don't just ask generic questions. Use AI as specialized experts:

**As UX Designer:**
> "Acting as a UX designer specializing in [your style], review this page for: information hierarchy, visual flow, interaction patterns, and accessibility. Compare to [style] best practices."

**As Accessibility Specialist:**
> "Acting as an accessibility specialist, audit this page for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Check: color contrast, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, ARIA labels, screen reader compatibility."

**As Literary Critic:**
> "Acting as a literary critic, review this blog post for: clarity, engagement, structure, voice consistency, and readability. Suggest specific improvements."

**As Performance Engineer:**
> "Acting as a performance engineer, analyze this site's load time, asset sizes, and rendering efficiency. Identify specific optimizations."

**As [Style] Design Expert:**
> "Acting as a [your style] design expert, critique every aspect of this page's visual design. What's authentic? What's not? What would [famous practitioner] change?"

### The Screenshot Workflow

AI cannot see your site. Screenshots are essential.

**When to screenshot:**
- After every significant change
- Before every design review
- When something looks wrong
- For mobile responsiveness checks
- To document progress

**How to share with AI:**
- Take screenshot (full page if possible)
- Share in chat with specific question
- Include reference images for comparison
- Ask AI to describe what it sees (verify it understands)

**Good screenshot prompts:**
- "Here's the homepage hero section. Compare to this reference image. What's different?"
- "This mobile layout feels cramped. Analyze the spacing and suggest improvements."
- "The typography hierarchy isn't working. What specifically is wrong?"

### Iterative Design Reviews

**Never accept first draft.** Review everything 2-3 times minimum.

**First review:** Broad issues (layout, colors, typography scale)  
**Second review:** Specific sections (hero, navigation, components)  
**Third review:** Details (spacing, alignment, consistency)

**Each review cycle:**
1. Screenshot current state
2. Compare to references
3. Identify specific problems
4. Describe changes needed
5. AI implements
6. Screenshot again
7. Repeat until excellent

### Managing Context Windows

AI has limited memory. Control context by organizing conversations:

**Separate chats for different purposes:**
- **Chat 1:** Initial extraction and planning
- **Chat 2:** Sprint 1 execution
- **Chat 3:** Sprint 2 execution
- **Chat 4:** Sprint 3 execution
- **Chat 5:** Final polish and reflection

**In each new chat:**
- Upload key documents (`design-system.md`, `sprint-plan.md`)
- Reference previous decisions: "In Sprint 1, we decided to use [pattern]. Continue that approach."
- Keep focused on current task

**When context gets messy:**
- Start a new chat
- Reload essential documents
- Summarize where you are: "We've completed Sprints 1-2. Now starting Sprint 3 to add content and polish."

### Strategic Prompting

**Be specific:**
- ❌ "Make it look better"
- ✅ "Increase line height to 1.6 and add 2rem of top padding"

**Provide context:**
- ❌ "Fix the navigation"
- ✅ "The navigation feels too heavy for [style] aesthetics. [Style] typically uses lighter, more minimal navigation. Simplify this while keeping it functional."

**Reference sources:**
- ❌ "Use the design system"
- ✅ "Reference `docs/design-system.md` section 3 (color palette) and apply those exact colors"

**Ask for reasoning:**
- "Why did you choose this approach?"
- "What's the [style] principle behind this decision?"
- "Explain the trade-offs here."

**Request alternatives:**
- "Show me 3 different ways to style this component"
- "What would happen if we used [alternative approach]?"

**Iterate strategically:**
- Start broad (overall layout)
- Then specific (individual components)
- Then details (spacing, alignment, polish)

### Knowing When Something's Wrong

**Trust your gut.** If something feels off, it probably is.

**Common signs:**
- "This looks too busy/cluttered"
- "The spacing feels wrong"
- "This doesn't match the references"
- "Mobile version is too cramped"
- "Colors are too aggressive/not enough contrast"
- "Typography hierarchy is confusing"

**When you sense a problem:**
1. Screenshot it
2. Compare to reference images
3. Describe what feels wrong (even if you can't articulate why precisely)
4. Ask AI to analyze: "What's causing this feeling of [crowdedness/imbalance/wrongness]?"
5. AI will identify specific technical issues
6. Fix and review again

**You don't need to know the technical solution.** You need to know something's wrong. AI finds the solution.
