# Design Quality Checklist
## Section-by-Section Review Tool

**For:** IS 218 Enterprise AI Studio Project  
**Purpose:** Systematic design review framework for each iteration

---

## 🎯 How to Use This Checklist

**During Phase 4 (Build & Iterate):**
- Take screenshot of section
- Review using this checklist
- Share findings with AI
- Iterate until criteria met
- Check off completed items

**Minimum 2-3 review cycles per section.**

## 📸 Screenshot Workflow

**Before Every Review:**

1. **Full Desktop Screenshot** (1920px width)
   - Chrome DevTools: Toggle device toolbar OFF
   - Capture entire section in context

2. **Tablet Screenshot** (768px width)
   - Chrome DevTools: Responsive mode
   - Set width to 768px exactly
   - Capture same section

3. **Mobile Screenshot** (375px width)
   - Chrome DevTools: iPhone SE preset
   - Portrait orientation
   - Capture same section

**Share all three with AI before review.**

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Don't Skip Mobile:**
Mobile reviews catch 80% of responsive issues. Always test mobile for every iteration.

**Use Three-Pass System:**
1. **Broad:** Overall impression, major issues
2. **Specific:** Section-by-section using this checklist
3. **Details:** Typography, spacing, consistency

**Trust Your Gut:**
If something feels wrong but you can't articulate why, screenshot it and ask AI: "This feels off to me. What might be causing that?"

**Iterate Boldly:**
First iteration usually too safe. Second iteration pushes style further. Third iteration refines the bold choices.

**Document Everything:**
Keep screenshots from each iteration. Your collaboration story will need them.
